# Seed: Super Admin User

## Overview
Seeds a single Super Admin account so the platform can be administered.
ALL demo/sample data (10 demo gyms, 10 gym-admin accounts, and all
membership-plan / member / attendance / payment rows) has been removed so
the platform starts at zero.

Gyms are added from the Super Admin panel (Gyms -> Add Gym), which also
auto-creates a per-gym GYM_ADMIN account with a random temporary password
that is shown once so the super admin can share it with the gym owner.

## Tables Modified
- users: 1 row inserted (SUPER_ADMIN only)

## Security
- Password is a bcrypt hash (cost factor 10), never plaintext
- Super Admin has gym_id = null (access to all gyms)
